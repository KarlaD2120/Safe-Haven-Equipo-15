# Safe-Haven

Safe Haven is a project dedicated to providing a safe space for women who feel in danger due to gender-based violence. The project features several sections aimed at educating, assisting, and providing resources for women in need.

## Features

### Help Button
The Help Button is a feature that allows users to alert their designated guardians when they feel in danger. Upon pressing the Help Button, a marker is placed on a map indicating the exact location of the user. Simultaneously, a message is sent to the user’s guardians, alerting them of the situation and providing them with the user’s location.

### What To Do
This section provides information and guidance on what to do if you’re experiencing gender-based violence. It aims to equip users with the knowledge and resources necessary to navigate such situations.

### Identifying Toxic Relationships
Understanding the signs of a toxic relationship can be the first step towards seeking help. This section provides information on how to identify if you’re in a toxic relationship.

### Resources
The Resources section provides information about organizations that users can reach out to if they need specific types of assistance. These organizations are dedicated to helping individuals who are experiencing gender-based violence.

## Installation
Since Safe Haven is a web application, installation is straightforward. From the terminal, navigate to the “client” directory and install the dependencies with the command yarn. Then, you can run the project with yarn dev.

## Usage
To use Safe Haven, you must first log in. If you do not have an account, you will need to register. During registration, you will provide your personal data, as well as the information of your guardians. These will be the individuals who will be notified when you press the help button.
